# Projekte 🛠️

Welcome to **Projekte** – a personal collection of small but mighty scripts, proof-of-concepts, and educational projects. This repository is a curated mess of Python automation, learning material, cybersecurity payloads, and random code experiments that make life a little easier (or more interesting).

Whether you're here to grab a payload, study from examples, or see how Python can run the boring stuff for you – there’s something in here for you.

## 🔥 What’s Inside

This repo is organized into multiple folders and categories for easy navigation. Below is a breakdown of what's included:

### 📁 `automation/`
> Everyday task automation using Python and shell scripts.

- **file_organizer.py** – Automatically sorts downloaded files into folders by type.
- **bulk_renamer.py** – Renames files in bulk based on patterns or timestamps.
- **weather_notifier.py** – Sends you the daily forecast via desktop notification.
- **pdf_merger.py** – Combines multiple PDFs into one.
- **screenshot_cleaner.py** – Detects and removes old screenshots.

### 📁 `payloads/`
> Offensive security scripts and small proof-of-concept tools.

- **reverse_shell.py** – A clean TCP reverse shell with optional AES encryption.
- **keylogger.py** – Captures keystrokes, logs them to file. (Educational use only.)
- **wifi_cracker.sh** – Automates WPA handshake capture (Aircrack-ng wrapper).
- **usb_spoof.py** – Emulates HID-style attacks using DuckyScript-style payloads.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These tools are for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Use responsibly.

### 📁 `education/`
> Snippets, explanations, and tiny scripts meant to teach or demonstrate concepts.

- **boolean_algebra_demo.py** – A live Python visualization of Boolean logic.
- **regex_cheatsheet.md** – Common regex patterns and use cases.
- **cli_tutorial.md** – Introduction to command line scripting with examples.
- **fizzbuzz_variants.py** – Different ways to solve FizzBuzz, from boring to cursed.

### 📁 `experiments/`
> Random things that don’t fit anywhere else but were fun to make.

- **ascii_dungeon.py** – Navigate a basic ASCII map with keyboard input.
- **tiny_lang.py** – A micro scripting language interpreter.
- **markdown_parser.py** – Parses markdown and prints a table of contents.
- **voice_assistant.py** – Basic offline voice command interpreter.
